## 🧪 Current Projects (That i will want to tell you all about)

- **Cybertyper** — A digital typewriter built with ESP32 and a retro-futuristic vibe  
- **Sakuji 🌱🛤️** — A handcrafted project manager for Apple devices that links your Reminders, Calendar, Notes, and Contacts into one emoji-tagged, beautifully chaotic ecosystem. Works offline, syncs with iCloud, and respects your brain.

## 🤝 Collaborations

Always open to interesting collabs — especially if they blend tech, design, and a little chaos.  
I’m particularly into tools that are fun to use, strange to look at, and deeply personal.

## 📫 Contact
